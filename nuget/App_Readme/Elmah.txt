Once you have installed ELMAH, a new httpHandler (elmah.axd) is configured within your application.
This is deliberately set up to be secure such that it can only be accessed locally.

Ideally you need to secure this further.
Please review the commented out authorization section under <location path="elmah.axd"> and
make the appropriate changes.

To understand why this is so important, please read this blog entry:

You should also read the project's wiki page on Securing Error Log Pages:
